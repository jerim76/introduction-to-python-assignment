Basic Calculator Program

Create a simple Python program that asks the user to input two numbers and a mathematical operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division).
Perform the operation based on the user's input and print the result.
Example: If a user inputs 10, 5, and +, your program should display 10 + 5 = 15.


def main():
     Get user input for two numbers and the operation
    num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
    num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))
    operation = input("Enter an operation (+, -, *, /): ")

     Perform the calculation based on the input operation
    if operation == '+':
        result = num1 + num2
        print(f"{num1} + {num2} = {result}")
    elif operation == '-':
        result = num1 - num2
        print(f"{num1} - {num2} = {result}")
    elif operation == '*':
        result = num1 * num2
        print(f"{num1} * {num2} = {result}")
    elif operation == '/':
         Check for division by zero
        if num2 != 0:
            result = num1 / num2
            print(f"{num1} / {num2} = {result}")
        else:
            print("Error: Division by zero is not allowed.")
    else:
        print("Invalid operation. Please use one of: +, -, *, /.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
